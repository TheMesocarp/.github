We're a cybernetics research collective focused on applications of algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and category theory in machine learning systems and civilian infrastructure.

We believe strongly in the open-source community and copyleft principles.

Our mission is to foster a community of like-minded community-first builders, to help democratize the incoming wave of homological software, and improve the systems we depend on in our everyday lives.
